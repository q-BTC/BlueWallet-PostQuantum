## To Run BlueWallet with qBTC

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Exit Root Mode First!
```bash
exit
```

### Option 1: Run as Regular User (Recommended)

1. **Exit root mode and switch to your user**:
   ```bash
   exit
   su - chris
   ```

2. **Navigate to BlueWallet directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/chris/Desktop/Development/BlueWallet
   ```

3. **Start Metro bundler**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **In a new terminal, run iOS**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/chris/Desktop/Development/BlueWallet
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

### Option 2: Run Android (Easier, No Root Issues)

1. **Start Metro bundler**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/chris/Desktop/Development/BlueWallet
   npm start
   ```

2. **In a new terminal, run Android**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/chris/Desktop/Development/BlueWallet
   npm run android
   ```

## Testing qBTC Functionality

### 1. Create a qBTC Wallet
- Launch BlueWallet
- Tap "+" to add wallet
- Select "qBTC" option
- Configure node URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
- Create wallet

### 2. Run a Local qBTC Node (Optional)
```bash
cd /Users/chris/Desktop/Development/qBTC-core
docker-compose up
```

### 3. Test Features
- Generate quantum-safe address
- View balance
- Send/receive qBTC
- View transaction history

## Troubleshooting

### If iOS Build Fails Due to Root
1. Clean Xcode derived data:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
   rm -rf /var/root/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*
   ```

2. Exit root and rebuild:
   ```bash
   exit
   cd /Users/chris/Desktop/Development/BlueWallet
   npx react-native run-ios
   ```

### If Metro Bundler Issues
```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### If Pod Install Fails
```bash
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install
cd ..
```

## Security Notes

- qBTC uses ML-DSA-87 (NIST Level 5 security)
- Private keys are ~4.6KB (much larger than Bitcoin)
- Always backup keys securely
- Consider running your own qBTC node

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check `/README-POST-QUANTUM.md` for detailed technical info
- Review error logs in Metro bundler
- Ensure qBTC node is running and accessible
